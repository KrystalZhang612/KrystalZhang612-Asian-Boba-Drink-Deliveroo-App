# KrystalZhang612-Asian-Boba-Drink-Deliveroo-App

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). A responsive Full-Stack Asian-Boba-delivering website using Next.js and MongoDB. This project contains a frontend-side, which are a homepage, product pages, cart total & a payment selection page to submit name & address & phone number details & checkout, with data fetched from MongoDB integration, and a backend-side Admin Dashboard as a merchant to receive payments. The user can choose any size, additional toppings and quantities into carts. The JS Redux library helps increase quantity numbers, and the PayPal library helps generate fake transactions. The amount increases immediately as the user makes a purchase. ***I have learned Next.js, MongoDB integration, server-side rendering, and tremendous knowledge of how to use cookies for authentication from implementing this project.***

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
